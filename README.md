Hello! The goal of this project is to recreate the Google homepage. By the end of this project, I should have a solid grasp on coding a website with both HTML and CSS. 

I hope to have a better understanding of how to move objects with CSS and how to stack multiple objects across a page, including headers, footers, buttons and a form. 

I'm hesistantly optimistic I can complete this within a few days, if not the end of today.

Let's go. Change starts today!
