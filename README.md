Hello! The goal of this project is to recreate the Google homepage. By the end of this project, I should have a solid grasp on coding a website with both HTML and CSS. 

I hope to have a better understanding of how to move objects with CSS and how to stack multiple objects across a page, including headers, footers, buttons and a form. 

Update 1.21.21:

Completed the project to the best of my ability. Some minor tweaks yet to come -- my buttons aren't quite right, I need to figure out how to add the mic to the search bar. Otherwise I think it looks largely close to the Google homepage!

Watched a few videos of trying to lay out the same project and listening to someone work through their own code and look for solutions helped me understand what I was trying to do. Need to sit down and work on CSS Grids.
